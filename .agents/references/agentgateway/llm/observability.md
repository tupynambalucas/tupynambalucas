# Observe traffic

Capture LLM metrics, logs, and traces, including request and response bodies and token usage,
through OpenTelemetry.

Get prompt logging, cost tracking, and a full audit trail: review LLM-specific metrics, logs, and
traces (request/response capture and token usage) via OpenTelemetry.

## Before you begin

Complete an LLM guide, such as the [virtual key
management](cost-controls/virtual-keys.md) guide. This guide sends a
request to the LLM and receives a response. You can use this request and response example to verify
metrics, logs, and traces.

## View LLM metrics

You can access the agentgateway metrics endpoint to view LLM-specific metrics, such as the number of
tokens that you used during a request or response.

1. Open the agentgateway [metrics endpoint](http://localhost:15020/metrics).
2. Look for the `agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage` metric. This metric is a [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) and includes important information about the request and the response from the LLM, such as:
   - `gen_ai_token_type`: Whether this metric is about a request (`input`) or response (`output`).
   - `gen_ai_operation_name`: The name of the operation that was performed.
   - `gen_ai_system`: The LLM provider that was used for the request/response.
   - `gen_ai_request_model`: The model that was used for the request.
   - `gen_ai_response_model`: The model that was used for the response.

For more information, see the [Semantic conventions for generative AI
metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics/) in the OpenTelemetry
docs.

## View realized costs

When you configure a [model cost catalog](cost-controls/costs.md),
agentgateway computes the realized USD cost of each LLM request and exposes it across the
observability surface:

- **Logs**: each LLM request log line includes `agw.ai.usage.cost.total`. Add the cost breakdown or applied rates with CEL `llm.cost` and `llm.costRates` fields.
- **Metrics**: the `agentgateway_cost_catalog_lookups_total` counter tracks lookups by `status` (`Exact`, `Unpriced`, `Missing`, or `NoCatalog`) and by provider and model, so you can confirm that your catalog prices your traffic.
- **Traces**: cost attributes are attached to the request span.

For catalog configuration and the full list of cost fields, see [Model
costs](cost-controls/costs.md).

## View traces

1. Use [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) to spin up a Jaeger instance
   with the following components:

   - An OpenTelemetry collector that receives traces from the agentgateway and forwards them to Jaeger. The collector is exposed on `http://localhost:4317`.
   - A Jaeger agent that receives the collected traces. The agent is exposed on `http://localhost:14268`.
   - A Jaeger UI that is exposed on `http://localhost:16686`.

   Steps to create a Jaeger instance:

   1. Create the OpenTelemetry collector configuration file in your current directory. The Compose file in
      the next step mounts this file into the collector container. Both files are sourced from the
      [`examples/mcp-telemetry`](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/tree/main/examples/mcp-telemetry)
      directory in the agentgateway repository.

      ```
      cat > otel-collector-config.yaml <<'EOF'
      receivers:
           otlp:
             protocols:
               grpc:
                 endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

         processors:
           batch: {}

         exporters:
           debug:
             verbosity: detailed
           otlp/jaeger:
             endpoint: jaeger:4317
             tls:
               insecure: true

         service:
           pipelines:
             logs:
               receivers: [otlp]
               processors: [batch]
               exporters: [debug]
             traces:
               receivers: [otlp]
               processors: [batch]
               exporters: [otlp/jaeger]

      EOF
      ```

   2. Spin up the Jaeger and collector containers.

      ```
      docker compose -f - up -d <<EOF
      services:
           jaeger:
             container_name: jaeger
             restart: unless-stopped
             image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
             ports:
             - "127.0.0.1:16686:16686"
             - "127.0.0.1:14268:14268"
             environment:
             - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true

           otel-collector:
             container_name: otel-collector
             image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.146.0
             volumes:
               - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
             ports:
               - "127.0.0.1:4317:4317"
             depends_on:
               - jaeger

      EOF
      ```

2. Configure your agentgateway proxy to emit traces and send them to the built-in OpenTelemetry
   collector agent.

   ```
   cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
   config:
     tracing:
       otlpEndpoint: http://localhost:4317
       randomSampling: true
   llm:
     models:
     - name: "*"
       provider: openAI
       params:
         apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
   EOF
   ```

3. Run your agentgateway proxy.

   ```
   agentgateway -f config.yaml
   ```

4. Send a request to the OpenAI provider. In simplified LLM configuration mode, the LLM listener uses
   port `4000` by default (port `3000` is reserved for MCP), and requests use the OpenAI-compatible
   `/v1/chat/completions` path.

   ```
   curl http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
     "model": "gpt-4o",
     "messages": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "Tell me a short story"
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

5. Open the [Jaeger UI](http://localhost:16686/search) and verify that you can see traces for your LLM
   request.

## View logs

Agentgateway automatically logs information to stdout. When you run agentgateway on your local
machine, you can view a log entry for each request that is sent to agentgateway in your CLI output.

Example for a successful request to the OpenAI LLM:

```
2025-12-12T21:56:02.809082Z	info	request gateway=agentgateway listener=http route=openai endpoint=api.openai.com:443
src.addr=127.0.0.1:60862 http.method=POST http.host=localhost http.path=/openai http.version=HTTP/1.1
http.status=200 protocol=llm gen_ai.operation.name=chat gen_ai.provider.name=openai
gen_ai.request.model=gpt-4o gen_ai.response.model=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
gen_ai.usage.input_tokens=68 gen_ai.usage.output_tokens=298 duration=2488ms
```

Example for a rate limited request:

```
2025-12-12T21:40:18.687849Z	info	request gateway=agentgateway listener=http route=openai endpoint=api.openai.com:443
src.addr=127.0.0.1:51794 http.method=POST http.host=localhost http.path=/openai http.version=HTTP/1.1
http.status=429 protocol=llm gen_ai.operation.name=chat gen_ai.provider.name=openai
gen_ai.request.model=gpt-4o error=rate limit exceeded duration=206ms
```
