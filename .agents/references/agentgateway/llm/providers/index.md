# Providers

Configure agentgateway for first-class, OpenAI-compatible, and self-hosted LLM providers

Learn how to configure agentgateway for a particular LLM provider**Provider**A service that provides
LLM capabilities, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure. Agentgateway supports multiple LLM providers
and can route to different providers based on configuration..

## First-class providers

Use the dedicated provider pages when agentgateway already knows the upstream base URL and request
format. This list includes Anthropic, OpenAI, and many more!

## Custom providers

Use [Custom providers](custom.md) only for providers that do not
have a first-class shortcut, such as Perplexity, vLLM, LM Studio, or another service that exposes a
compatible [API format](../api-types).

## Authentication

For simplified `llm` configuration, upstream provider authentication is configured per model via
`llm.models[]` (typically `params.apiKey` for API-key providers, and `auth` for cloud-native flows).
In routing-based configurations, use `policies.backendAuth` on a route instead.

### API key

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Use `auth.key.location` only when a provider needs the credential somewhere other than its default
location. For example, Azure often uses `api-key`:

```
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider:
      custom:
        formats:
        - type: completions
    auth:
      key:
        value: "$API_KEY"
        location:
          header:
            name: api-key
```

### Credential passthrough

To forward the validated incoming JWT to the upstream provider, use `passthrough`:

```
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    auth:
      passthrough: {}
```

### Cloud provider auth

- **Google Cloud**: `auth.gcp` uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) and can fetch an access token or ID token (depending on the `type` you select).
- **AWS**: `auth.aws` signs upstream requests with SigV4 using standard AWS credentials (for example, environment variables, an instance profile, or a shared config profile).
- **Azure**: `auth.azure` uses Entra ID. `auth.azure.implicit` uses the Azure SDK’s `DefaultAzureCredential` to discover credentials automatically.

These are the default auth mechanisms for the corresponding built-in providers, so you usually only
need to override them when you need custom credential handling.

```
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: vertex
    auth:
      gcp:
        type: accessToken
  - name: "*"
    provider: bedrock
    auth:
      aws: {}
  - name: "*"
    provider: azure
    auth:
      azure:
        implicit: {}
```

## Standalone upstream TLS

Use `llm.models[].tls` to configure advanced TLS when connecting to an upstream provider. When using
built in providers, default TLS settings are used. When using custom a `baseUrl`, the `https://`
scheme will automatically use TLS.

However, if you need advanced configurations such as client certificates or customized verification
steps, you may set fields such as `root` for a trusted CA bundle, `hostname` and `subjectAltNames`
for upstream identity checks, `cert` and `key` for client certificates.
