# About guardrails

How agentgateway’s content safety controls, such as PII detection and DLP, layer to guard LLM
requests and responses.

Protect LLM requests and responses from sensitive data exposure and harmful content using layered
content safety controls.

## About

In agentgateway, you can use guardrails to help prevent sensitive information from reaching LLM
providers and block harmful content in both requests and responses. Guardrails broadly cover a range
of content safety techniques including personally identifiable information (PII) detection, PII
sanitization, data loss prevention, prompt guards, and other guardrail features.

You can layer multiple protection mechanisms to create comprehensive guardrail protection:

- **Regex-based filters**: Fast, deterministic matching for known patterns like credit cards, SSNs, emails, and custom patterns
- **External moderation**: Leverage built-in model moderation endpoints and cloud provider-specific guardrails for advanced content filtering
- **Custom webhooks**: Integrate your own content safety logic for specialized requirements

## How guardrails works

Agentgateway checks for content safety in the request and response paths. You can configure multiple
prompt guards that run in sequence, allowing you to combine different detection methods.

```

        Guard-->>Gateway: Pass/Reject/Mask

        alt Passed Moderation
            Gateway->>Guard: 3. Custom webhook (if configured)
            Guard-->>Gateway: Pass/Reject/Mask

            alt Passed All Guards
                Gateway->>LLM: Forward sanitized request
                LLM-->>Gateway: Generate response
                Gateway->>Guard: Response guards
                Guard-->>Gateway: Pass/Reject/Mask
                Gateway-->>Client: Return sanitized response
            end
        end
    else Rejected
        Gateway-->>Client: Return rejection message
    end
```

The diagram shows content flowing through multiple guard layers. Each layer can:

- **Pass**: Allow content to proceed to the next layer
- **Reject**: Block the request and return an error message
- **Mask**: Replace sensitive patterns with placeholders and continue

Both actions are available on the request path and the response path. A response guard can reject a
response as well as mask it.

## Shared and model-specific guardrails

Use `llm.policies.guardrails` to define a shared baseline for every LLM model. You can then add
extra guardrails on an individual model with `llm.models[].guardrails`.

When both are configured, agentgateway merges the shared and model-specific guardrails for the
selected model. In practice, that means a model can inherit organization-wide checks and still add
stricter request or response filters for a specific use case.

## Streaming guardrails

By default, guardrails run only on buffered LLM traffic. When a client sets `"stream": true`, the
LLM response is streamed to the client, and response guards do not run at all.

To run guardrails on streamed content, set the `streaming` field on the guardrails that you want to
apply. Set `llm.policies.guardrails.streaming` for the shared baseline, or
`llm.models[].guardrails.streaming` for a single model.

```
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    guardrails:
      streaming: Enabled
      response:
      - regex:
          action: reject
          rules:
          - builtin: email
```

| Value      | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Disabled` | The default. Guardrails run only on buffered LLM traffic.                                                                    |
| `Enabled`  | Guardrails also run on streamed content, including server-sent events (SSE) responses and OpenAI Realtime WebSocket traffic. |

> [!WARNING] Warning The mask action does not apply to a streamed response. Agentgateway can block a streamed response, but it cannot rewrite content that is already on its way to the client. A response guard that matches content and uses action: mask passes that content through unmodified. The client receives no error, and the proxy records no guardrail event. The same limit applies to every response guard that modifies content, such as a webhook guard that returns a mask action, or AWS Bedrock Guardrails anonymization. To protect a streamed response, use action: reject . When the guard matches, agentgateway ends the stream and sends a guardrail_blocked error event to the client.

Request guards do not have this limit. A request is buffered before it reaches the LLM provider, so
both `mask` and `reject` apply to requests whether or not the client asks for a streamed response.

## Choosing the right approach

## Performance considerations

Each content safety layer adds latency to requests. Plan your configuration accordingly:

- **Regex guards**: < 1ms per check, negligible latency impact
- **External moderation**: 50-200ms depending on provider and network latency
- **Custom webhooks**: Varies based on webhook implementation and location

To optimize performance:

- Use regex for fast, deterministic checks before slower external checks
- Deploy webhook servers in the same region as agentgateway
- Configure appropriate timeouts for external moderation endpoints
- Consider request size limits to avoid processing very large prompts
