# Passthrough

Forward requests to the upstream provider without transformation.

The `passthrough` route type forwards requests to the upstream LLM provider as-is, without
translating between API formats.

## About

By default, agentgateway interprets known endpoints (such as `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`,
and `/v1/responses`) and translates between provider API formats. The `passthrough` route type
instead forwards the request to the backend provider unmodified.

Use passthrough for endpoints that agentgateway does not natively translate, or when you want the
provider to receive the request exactly as the client sent it. Because the request is not
interpreted as LLM traffic, LLM policies such as prompt guards, prompt enrichment, and request-body
rate limiting do not apply.

In the simplified `llm` configuration, any path that does not match a known endpoint falls back to
the `passthrough` route type automatically.

## Route type configuration

To pass all traffic through without interpretation, set `passthrough: opaque` on the model in the
simplified `llm` configuration.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    passthrough: opaque
```

To configure passthrough as a fallback for unmatched paths in the `gateways` and `routes` format,
map the `*` wildcard path to the `passthrough` route type.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 4000
routes:
- backends:
  - ai:
      name: openai
      provider:
        openAI: {}
  policies:
    ai:
      routes:
        "/v1/chat/completions": "completions"
        "*": "passthrough"
    backendAuth:
      key: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

## Extract telemetry from passthrough traffic

To pass requests through while still extracting token usage and rate-limit data when possible, set
`passthrough: detect`. This inspects the request and response to record telemetry, but does not
apply guardrails.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    passthrough: detect
```
