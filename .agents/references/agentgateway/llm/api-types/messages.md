# Messages

Send requests through agentgateway using the Anthropic Messages API.

The Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`) is the native interface for Anthropic Claude models.

## About

The [Anthropic Messages API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) is the primary
endpoint for Claude models. Agentgateway proxies these requests to your configured providers while
providing token usage tracking, observability metrics, and policy enforcement.

When using the Anthropic provider, Agentgateway automatically handles additional requirements, such
as the `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version` headers that the Anthropic API requires.

The related [`/v1/messages/count_tokens`](token-count.md)
endpoint estimates token usage before sending a request and is handled by the `anthropicTokenCount`
route type.

## Route type configuration

In the simplified `llm` configuration, agentgateway automatically maps `/v1/messages` requests to
the `messages` route type, so no explicit route configuration is required.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: anthropic
    params:
      apiKey: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

To configure the route type explicitly, use the `gateways` and `routes` format and set the
`messages` route type in the `policies.ai.routes` map. To also support token counting, map
`/v1/messages/count_tokens` to the `anthropicTokenCount` route type.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 4000
routes:
- backends:
  - ai:
      name: anthropic
      provider:
        anthropic: {}
  policies:
    ai:
      routes:
        "/v1/messages": "messages"
        "/v1/messages/count_tokens": "anthropicTokenCount"
    backendAuth:
      key: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

## Using the API

Send a request to the `/v1/messages` endpoint. The request is forwarded to the Anthropic API and the
response is returned to the client.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
