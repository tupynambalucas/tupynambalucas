# Rerank

Send rerank requests through agentgateway using the Cohere-compatible Rerank API.

The Rerank API (`/v2/rerank`) scores a list of documents against a query and returns the most
relevant results in ranked order.

## About

Agentgateway supports the Cohere-compatible Rerank API. Use rerank when you already have a candidate
set of documents, such as from keyword search or vector search, and want a model to reorder those
documents by relevance to a query.

Agentgateway also recognizes `/v1/rerank` as a rerank route, but `/v2/rerank` is the
Cohere-compatible endpoint.

## Route type configuration

In the simplified `llm` configuration, agentgateway automatically maps `/v2/rerank` requests to the
`rerank` route type, so no explicit route configuration is required.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: cohere
    params:
      apiKey: "$COHERE_API_KEY"
```

To configure the route type explicitly, use the `gateways` and `routes` format and set the `rerank`
route type in the `policies.ai.routes` map.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 4000
routes:
- backends:
  - ai:
      name: cohere
      provider:
        custom:
          formats:
          - type: rerank
      hostOverride: api.cohere.ai:443
  policies:
    ai:
      routes:
        "/v2/rerank": "rerank"
    backendAuth:
      key: "$COHERE_API_KEY"
```

> [!NOTE] Note For detailed information about model routing and configuration modes, see Model routing and aliases .

## Using the API

Send a request to the `/v2/rerank` endpoint with a query and candidate documents. The response ranks
the documents by relevance.

```
curl 'http://localhost:4000/v2/rerank' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "model": "rerank-v3.5",
  "query": "What does agentgateway do?",
  "documents": [
    "agentgateway routes, secures, and observes agent and LLM traffic.",
    "A bicycle drivetrain transfers power from pedals to wheels.",
    "Vector databases store embeddings for semantic search."
  ],
  "top_n": 2
}'
```
