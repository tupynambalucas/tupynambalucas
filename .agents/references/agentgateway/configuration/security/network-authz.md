Enforce access control at the L4 level using CEL expressions.

Network authorization enforces access control at the L4 (transport) level, before HTTP processing.
You can enforce policies for non-HTTP traffic such as raw TCP and TLS connections, and layer L4+L7
controls when you combine policies with [HTTP
authorization](http-authz.md).

Network authorization uses [CEL expressions](../../reference/cel/index.md) evaluated
against the connection’s source context.

## Configuration

Configure network authorization as a frontend policy under `frontendPolicies.networkAuthorization`.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
frontendPolicies:
  networkAuthorization:
    rules:
    - allow: 'source.address == "10.0.0.0" || source.address == "10.0.0.1"'
    - deny: 'source.address == "192.168.1.100"'
    - require: 'source.port > 1024'

gateways:
  default:
    port: 3000
routes:
- backends:
  - host: localhost:8080
```

## Rules

Network authorization supports the same rule types as HTTP authorization:

| Rule type | Behavior                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allow`   | If any `allow` rule matches, the connection is permitted.     |
| `deny`    | If any `deny` rule matches, the connection is rejected.       |
| `require` | All `require` rules must match for the connection to proceed. |

Evaluation order:

1. If there are no rules, the connection is allowed.
2. If any `deny` rule matches, the connection is rejected.
3. All `require` rules must match.
4. If any `allow` rule matches, the connection is allowed.
5. If only `deny` rules exist, unmatched connections are allowed (denylist semantics).
6. If `allow` rules exist but none matched, the connection is rejected (allowlist semantics).

## CEL context

The following CEL variables are available in network authorization rules:

| Variable                       | Type           | Description                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source.address`               | `string`       | IP address of the downstream connection.               |
| `source.port`                  | `int`          | Port of the downstream connection.                     |
| `source.tls.identity`          | `string`       | Client certificate identity (if mTLS).                 |
| `source.tls.subject_alt_names` | `list(string)` | Subject Alternative Names from the client certificate. |

## Examples

### Allow only private network ranges

```
frontendPolicies:
  networkAuthorization:
    rules:
    - allow: 'cidr("10.0.0.0/8").containsIP(source.address) || cidr("172.16.0.0/12").containsIP(source.address) || cidr("192.168.0.0/16").containsIP(source.address)'
```

### Require mTLS client identity

```
frontendPolicies:
  networkAuthorization:
    rules:
    - require: 'source.tls.identity == "spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/my-service"'
```

### Layered L4+L7 controls

Combine network authorization with HTTP authorization for defense in depth.

```
frontendPolicies:
  networkAuthorization:
    rules:
    - allow: 'cidr("10.0.0.0/8").containsIP(source.address)'

gateways:
  default:
    port: 3000
routes:
- backends:
  - host: localhost:8080
  policies:
    authorization:
      rules:
      - require: 'jwt.aud == "my-service"'
```

In this example, only connections from the `10.0.0.0/8` range are accepted at the network level, and
those connections must also present a valid JWT with the correct audience claim.
