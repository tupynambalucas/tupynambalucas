When authorization**Authorization (AuthZ)**The process of determining what actions an authenticated
user or service is allowed to perform. Agentgateway supports HTTP authorization, MCP authorization,
and external authorization services. decisions need to be made out-of-process, use an external
authorization policy. This policy has agentgateway send the request to an external server, such as
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/envoy) which decides whether the request is
allowed or denied. You can configure agentgateway to do this by using the [External Authorization
gRPC
service](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/service/auth/v3/external_auth.proto) or
by using HTTP requests.

## gRPC External Authorization

The [Envoy External Authorization gRPC
service](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/service/auth/v3/external_auth.proto)
provides a standardized API to make authorization decisions. Agentgateway is API-compatible with the
Envoy External Authorization gRPC service.

> [!NOTE] Note gRPC refers to the protocol of the external authorization service. The service can authorize both gRPC and HTTP requests from the user.

When an ExtAuthz server returns header modifications, agentgateway uses `insert` instead of `append`
for response headers. This ensures headers are properly set rather than potentially duplicated.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  policies:
    extAuthz:
      host: localhost:9000
      protocol:
        grpc:
          # Optional: metadata to send to the external authorization service
          # The value is a CEL expression
          metadata:
            dev.agentgateway.jwt: '{"claims": jwt}'
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
mcp:
  port: 3000
  policies:
    extAuthz:
      host: localhost:9000
      protocol:
        grpc:
          # Optional: metadata to send to the external authorization service
          # The value is a CEL expression
          metadata:
            dev.agentgateway.jwt: '{"claims": jwt}'
  targets:
  - name: everything
    stdio:
      cmd: npx
      args: ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]
```

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 3000
routes:
- policies:
    extAuthz:
      host: localhost:9000
      protocol:
        grpc:
          # Optional: metadata to send to the external authorization service
          # The value is a CEL expression
          metadata:
            dev.agentgateway.jwt: '{"claims": jwt}'
  backends:
  - host: localhost:8080
```

The remaining examples in this section show only the `extAuthz` policy. Attach each one to a
listener, route, or backend as needed.

### Cache authorization results

You can cache gRPC external authorization decisions with `extAuthz.cache`. Caching is supported only
for `protocol.grpc`; HTTP external authorization requests are always sent to the authorization
service.

> [!WARNING] Warning The cache key must include every request property that your authorization service uses to make a decision. For example, if the service evaluates both the request path and the Authorization header, include both values in cache.key . Otherwise, agentgateway can incorrectly reuse one request’s authorization result for another request.

If any `cache.key` expression fails to evaluate or returns an unsupported value, agentgateway still
sends the request to the authorization service, but skips both the cache lookup and the cache write
for that request.

Use the following fields to configure the cache:

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cache.key`        | Required ordered list of 1-16 CEL expressions used to build the cache key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `cache.ttl`        | Required expiration for cached results. Set this to a duration such as `"5m"`, to a CEL expression that returns a duration, or to a CEL expression that returns the timestamp when the cached result expires. The expression is evaluated after the authorization response has been applied to the request. |
| `cache.maxEntries` | Optional maximum number of cached authorization results. If unset, agentgateway defaults to `10000`.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Example configuration:

```
extAuthz:
  host: localhost:9000
  protocol:
    grpc:
      metadata:
        dev.agentgateway.jwt: '{"claims": jwt}'
  cache:
    key:
      - request.method
      - request.path
      - request.headers["authorization"]
    ttl: '"5m"'
    maxEntries: 20000
```

## HTTP External Authorization

HTTP External Authorization allows sending plain HTTP requests to an authorization service. If the
service returns a 2xx status code, the request is allowed. Otherwise, it is denied.

Example configuration: For the full set of options, see the [configuration
reference](../../reference/configuration/index.md).

```
extAuthz:
  host: localhost:9000
  protocol:
    includeRequestHeaders:
      # By default, only the Authorization header is included.
      - cookie
    http:
      # We send to /auth/<original request path>.
      path: |
        "/auth" + request.path
      includeResponseHeaders:
      # Pass the user request to the upstream service.
      # This is not required, and is just an example
      - x-auth-request-user
```

For advanced cases, configure settings for the request to the authorization service, as well as the
response from the authorization service. For example, configure `redirect` to redirect users to a
sign-in page, and `metadata` to extract information from the authorization response to include in
logs. Review the following table for more advanced options.

| Option                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `protocol.http.path`                     | CEL expression to construct the request path                                                                                                                   |
| `protocol.http.includeResponseHeaders`   | Specific headers from the authorization response will be copied into the request to the backend.                                                               |
| `protocol.http.addRequestHeaders`        | Specific headers to add in the authorization request, based on the CEL expression                                                                              |
| `protocol.http.redirect`                 | When server returns “unauthorized”, redirect to the URL resolved by the provided expression rather than directly returning the error.                          |
| `protocol.http.metadata`                 | Metadata to include under the `extauthz` variable, based on the authorization response.                                                                        |
| `includeRequestHeaders`                  | Specific headers to include in the authorization request. If unset, the gRPC protocol sends all request headers. The HTTP protocol sends only ‘Authorization’. |
| `includeRequestBody`                     | Options for including the request body in the authorization request                                                                                            |
| `includeRequestBody.maxRequestBytes`     | Maximum size of request body to buffer (default: 8192)                                                                                                         |
| `includeRequestBody.allowPartialMessage` | If true, send partial body when max_request_bytes is reached                                                                                                   |

## Backend connection policies

You can configure connection policies on the `extAuthz` field to secure or tune how agentgateway
connects to the external authorization service. This includes TLS, authentication, and connection
timeouts.

```
extAuthz:
  host: authz-server:9001
  policies:
    backendTLS:
      root: /certs/ca.pem
      hostname: authz-server
    backendAuth:
      key:
        file: /secrets/api-key
    http:
      requestTimeout: "5s"
  protocol:
    grpc: {}
```

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `policies.backendTLS`          | TLS settings for the connection to the authorization service. Use `root` to specify a CA cert, `hostname` to override the SNI hostname, `insecure: true` to skip certificate verification (not recommended for production). |
| `policies.backendAuth`         | Credentials to authenticate to the authorization service. Supports `key` (API key from file or inline), `gcp`, `aws`, and `azure` auth.                                                                                     |
| `policies.http.requestTimeout` | Request-level timeout as a duration string (for example, `"5s"`).                                                                                                                                                           |
| `policies.tcp.connectTimeout`  | Connection timeout as a duration string, such as `3s`. When you set any `tcp` option, you must also set `keepalives`. Use `keepalives: {}` to keep the keepalive defaults.                                                  |

## Backend-level external authorization

You can also attach an `extAuthz` policy directly to a backend. Backend-level external authorization
runs after agentgateway selects the backend, so the policy applies even when a route load-balances
or fails over across multiple backends. Attach at the backend level when the authorization service
shapes the outgoing request, for example by inserting a token, rather than only deciding whether the
incoming request is allowed.

```
gateways:
  default:
    port: 3000
routes:
- backends:
  - host: localhost:8080
    policies:
      extAuthz:
        host: localhost:9000
        protocol:
          grpc: {}
```

## Conditional execution

To choose between multiple external authorization servers based on the request, use the
`conditional` field. For example, you can send admin paths to a stricter authorization server and
route every other request to a standard one. For details, see [Conditional
policies](../policies/conditional-policies.md).
