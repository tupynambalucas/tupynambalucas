## About CSRF protection

According to [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf), CSRF is defined as follows:

> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions
> on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social
> engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web
> application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a
> successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring
> funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF
> can compromise the entire web application.

To help prevent CSRF attacks, the CSRF policy implements a multi-layered validation approach to
allow or block requests based on their properties. The policy checks that the request’s origin
matches its destination. If the origin and destination do not match, a 403 Forbidden error code is
returned. Unlike CORS, CSRF protection works with all HTTP clients, not just browsers.

Review the following diagram to see an example CSRF request flow:

```
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker as Malicious Site<br/>(attacker.com)
    participant User as User's Browser
    participant AGW as AgentGateway Proxy
    participant Backend as Backend Service

    Note over Attacker,Backend: CSRF Attack Attempt

    Attacker->>User: Trick user into visiting<br/>malicious page with hidden form
    User->>AGW: POST /api/action<br/>Origin: malicioussite.com<br/>Cookie: session=abc123

    AGW->>AGW: CSRF validation:<br/>Origin (malicioussite.com)<br/>vs Destination (api.example.com)

    alt Origin does NOT match destination<br/>and NOT in additionalOrigins
        AGW-->>User: 403 Forbidden<br/>"CSRF validation failed"
        Note over User,AGW: Attack blocked
    end

    Note over User,Backend: Legitimate Request

    User->>AGW: POST /api/action<br/>Origin: allowThisOne.example.com<br/>Cookie: session=abc123

    AGW->>AGW: CSRF validation:<br/>Origin in additionalOrigins list
    AGW->>Backend: Forward request
    Backend-->>AGW: 200 OK
    AGW-->>User: 200 OK
```

### Allowed requests

Allowed requests are as follows.

- Safe methods (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`) from any origin
- Same-origin requests (`Origin` matches `Host`)
- Requests from origins in `additionalOrigins`
- Requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`

### Blocked requests

Blocked requests, which receive a `403 Forbidden` response with the message “CSRF validation
failed”, are as follows.

- Cross-site requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` (unless trusted)
- Cross-site requests where `Origin` doesn’t match `Host` (unless trusted)
- Malformed `Origin` headers in cross-site contexts

> [!NOTE] Note Note that because CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, the filter only acts on HTTP requests that have a state-changing method such as POST or PUT .

## Configuration

Review the following example configuration.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
mcp:
  port: 3000
  policies:
    csrf:
      additionalOrigins:
      - "https://www.example.com"
      - "https://trusted.domain.com"
  targets:
  - name: everything
    stdio:
      cmd: npx
      args: ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]
```

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 3000
routes:
- policies:
    csrf:
      additionalOrigins:
      - "https://www.example.com"
      - "https://trusted.domain.com"
  backends:
  - host: localhost:8080
```

The `additionalOrigins` setting is a list of trusted origins allowed to make cross-site requests.

- Format: `"scheme://host[:port]"`
- Examples: `"https://www.example.com"`, `"http://localhost:3000"`

For strict CSRF protection to prevent all cross-site requests, set `additionalOrigins` to an empty
list, as shown in the following route-level policy.

```
policies:
  csrf:
    additionalOrigins: []
```
