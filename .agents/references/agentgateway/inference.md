# Inference routing

Configure Kubernetes Gateway API or standalone inference routing for AI workloads.

Agentgateway supports the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension in two deployment modes.

## Kubernetes Gateway API mode

In Kubernetes Gateway API mode, agentgateway runs as the gateway data plane for Gateway API
resources. You install the Inference Extension CRDs, create an `InferencePool`, and route to that
pool from an `HTTPRoute`. The Endpoint Picker Extension (EPP) acts as an extension service that
selects the best model server endpoint for each inference request.

Use this mode when you want Gateway API integration, `InferencePool` resources, traffic splitting,
route matching, and other Kubernetes networking features.

## Standalone request scheduler mode

In standalone request scheduler mode, agentgateway runs as a sidecar proxy with the EPP. The proxy
and EPP communicate over localhost, and agentgateway uses its standalone `inferenceRouting` local
configuration to route requests to a synthetic service before consulting the EPP for endpoint
selection.

Use this mode for single-tenant or job-scoped workloads where deploying a full Gateway API stack
would add unnecessary operational overhead. In this mode, the [upstream standalone Helm
chart](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/tree/main/config/charts) can deploy agentgateway as the
sidecar proxy with `proxyType: agentgateway`.

Standalone request scheduler mode does not support `InferencePool`. The standalone configuration
must define a top-level synthetic service, such as a `services` entry, and the route backend must
reference that service. When EPP owns endpoint discovery, set `destinationMode: passthrough` so
EPP-selected destinations can be forwarded to directly without matching local workload endpoint
data.

For example, the standalone agentgateway configuration defines the synthetic service in `services`,
and the route backend references it as `default/my-model`.

[config.yaml](https:/agentgateway.dev/examples/llm-standalone-epp/config.yaml)

```
services:
- name: my-model
  namespace: default
  hostname: my-model
  vips: []
  ports:
    8000: 8000

binds:
- port: 8081
  listeners:
  - name: default
    protocol: HTTP
    routes:
    - name: standalone-epp
      matches:
      - path:
          pathPrefix: /v1/chat/completions
      backends:
      - service:
          name: default/my-model
          port: 8000
        policies:
          inferenceRouting:
            endpointPicker:
              host: 127.0.0.1:9002
            destinationMode: passthrough
```
