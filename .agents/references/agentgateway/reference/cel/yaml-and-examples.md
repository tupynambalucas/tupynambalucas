# CEL in YAML and example expressions

How to embed CEL expressions in YAML configuration, plus worked examples for common use cases.

## CEL in YAML

When writing CEL expressions in agentgateway, typically they are expressed as YAML string values,
which can cause confusion. Any string literals within the expression need to be escaped with
additional quotes.

These examples all represent the same CEL expression, a string literal `"hello"`.

```
doubleQuote: "'hello'"
doubleQuoteEscaped: "\"hello\""
singleQuote: '"hello"'
blockSingle: |
  'hello'
blockDouble: |
  "hello"
```

These examples all represent the same CEL expression, a variable `request`:

```
doubleQuote: "request"
singleQuote: 'request'
block: |
  request
```

The `block` style is often the most readable for complex expressions, and also allows for multi-line
expressions without needing to escape quotes.

## Example expressions

Review the following examples of expressions for different use cases.

### Default function

You can use the `default` function to provide a fallback value if the expression cannot be resolved.

Request header fallback with example of an anonymous user:

```
default(request.headers["x-user-id"], "anonymous")
```

Nested object fallback with example of light theme:

```
default(json(request.body).user.preferences.theme, "light")
```

JWT**JWT (JSON Web Token)**A compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting
information between parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in
agentgateway. claim fallback with example of default “user” role:

```
default(jwt.role, "user")
```

### Logs, traces, and observability

```
# Include logs where there was no response or there was an error
filter: |
   !has(response) || response.code > 299
fields:
  add:
    user.agent: 'request.headers["user-agent"]'
    # A static string. Note the expression is a string, and it returns a string, hence the double quotes.
    span.name: '"openai.chat"'
    gen_ai.usage.prompt_tokens: 'llm.input_tokens'
    # Parse the JSON request body, and conditionally log...
    # * If `type` is sum, val1+val2
    # * Else, val3
    # Example JSON request: `{"type":"sum","val1":2,"val2":3,"val4":"hello"}`
    json.field: |
      json(request.body).with(b,
         b.type == "sum" ?
           b.val1 + b.val2 :
           b.val3
      )
```

### Authorization

```
mcpAuthorization:
  rules:
  # Allow anyone to call 'echo'
  - 'mcp.tool.name == "echo"'
  # Only the test-user can call 'add'
  - 'jwt.sub == "test-user" && mcp.tool.name == "add"'
  # Any authenticated user with the claim `nested.key == value` can access 'printEnv'
  - 'mcp.tool.name == "printEnv" && jwt.nested.key == "value"'
```

### Rate limiting

```
remoteRateLimit:
   descriptors:
   # Rate limit requests based on a header, whether the user is authenticated, and a static value (used to match a specific rate limit rule on the rate limit server)
   - entries:
      - key: some-static-value
        value: '"something"'
      - key: organization
        value: 'request.headers["x-organization"]'
      - key: authenticated
        value: 'has(jwt.sub)'
```
