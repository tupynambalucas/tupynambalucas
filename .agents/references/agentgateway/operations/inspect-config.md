# Inspect agentgateway configuration

Inspect the runtime configuration that a standalone agentgateway instance has loaded.

> [!WARNING] Warning This feature is experimental. Try it out, see how it helps, and provide us feedback in GitHub or Discord. But keep in mind that it is subject to change and not supported for production.

Inspect the runtime configuration that a standalone agentgateway instance loaded by using `agctl
proxy config`.

## About

`agctl proxy config` reads the agentgateway admin endpoint at `/config_dump` and renders the result
as a structured table or as JSON or YAML. Use it to confirm what the proxy actually loaded,
especially when a config change appears to apply but the proxy does not behave as expected.

For a standalone agentgateway instance, you provide the config dump as a file. `agctl proxy config`
does not have a `--local` flag. Instead, capture the dump from the admin port and pass it to `agctl
proxy config all --file <path>`.

`agctl proxy config` includes the following subcommands.

| Subcommand                    | What it returns                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agctl proxy config all`      | The full runtime configuration: binds, listeners, routes, backends, workloads, services, and policies.                                       |
| `agctl proxy config backends` | A table of backends and their endpoint health, request counts, and latency. Most useful in Kubernetes mode where xDS feeds the service list. |

## Before you begin

- [Install agctl](agctl.md).
- Have an agentgateway instance running locally, such as the [non-agentic HTTP quickstart](../quickstart/non-agentic-http.md) setup.

## Capture the config dump

Save the agentgateway admin endpoint’s `/config_dump` output to a file.

```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:15000/config_dump > /tmp/agw-dump.json
```

If you set a custom admin address in your config file, replace `127.0.0.1:15000` with the host and
port that you configured.

## Render the full configuration

Render the dump as YAML, which is easier to scan than JSON.

```
agctl proxy config all --file /tmp/agw-dump.json -o yaml
```

Example output (truncated):

```
backends:
- backend:
    host:
      name: default/default/bind/3000/listener0/default/httpbin/backend0
      namespace: ""
      target: 127.0.0.1:8000
binds:
- address: '[::]:3000'
  key: bind/3000
  listeners:
    default/default/bind/3000/listener0:
      gatewayName: default
      gatewayNamespace: default
      hostname: ""
      key: default/default/bind/3000/listener0
      listenerName: listener0
      protocol: HTTP
      routes:
        default/default/bind/3000/listener0/default/httpbin:
          backends:
          - backend: /default/default/bind/3000/listener0/default/httpbin/backend0
            weight: 1
          key: default/default/bind/3000/listener0/default/httpbin
          matches:
          - path:
              pathPrefix: /
          name: httpbin
          namespace: default
...
```

The output includes the agentgateway version, build info, and all loaded `binds`, `listeners`,
`routes`, `backends`, and `policies`. Use it to confirm that your config file loaded as expected.

## Use other output formats

`agctl proxy config all` accepts the `-o` flag with `short` (default), `json`, and `yaml` values.
The `short` and `json` outputs both return the full pretty-printed configuration. Note that there is
no compressed table view for the full configuration.

```
# Pretty-printed JSON
agctl proxy config all --file /tmp/agw-dump.json -o json

# YAML
agctl proxy config all --file /tmp/agw-dump.json -o yaml
```

## Pipe the output to other tools

Pipe the JSON output through tools like `jq` to extract specific fields. The following examples
assume that you are running the standalone agentgateway example with a single bind on port `3000`.

```
# List route names
agctl proxy config all --file /tmp/agw-dump.json -o json | jq '.binds[].listeners[].routes[].name'

# Show only the backends
agctl proxy config all --file /tmp/agw-dump.json -o json | jq '.backends'
```
