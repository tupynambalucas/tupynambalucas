# Bounded Context: AI Agents Configuration

This bounded context ([.agents/](./)) manages the lifecycle, personas, tools, and domain-specific knowledge for AI agents operating within the tupynambalucas.dev monorepo. It strictly adheres to the Antigravity (AGY) customization architecture.

---

## 1. Directory Architecture

- **[plans/](./plans/)**: Temporary, markdown-based execution plans for complex refactors.
- **[plugins/](./plugins/)**: Bundled MCP (Model Context Protocol) definitions, server lifecycle configs, and associated rules (e.g., the `cortex` plugin routing to `cortex_agentgateway`).
- **[rules/](./rules/)**: Global or localized markdown constraints that are automatically injected into the agent's context based on location or trigger conditions.
- **[scripts/](./scripts/)**: MUST be used ONLY for utility scripts (Node.js, Bash) that are executed by AI agents (both temporary and permanent). Human-operated scripts do not belong here.
- **[skills/](./skills/)**: Self-contained Markdown instruction files defining expert personas, validation workflows, and multi-step runbooks. Loaded on demand via progressive disclosure.

---

## 2. Agent Constraints

1. **Root Script Ban**: Agents MUST NEVER create temporary or utility scripts (e.g., `scratch.js`, `update.js`) directly in the monorepo root.
2. **Script Location**: The [scripts/](./scripts/) directory is STRICTLY for scripts executed by AI agents (temporary or permanent). Agents MUST save their scripts here instead of the root directory. Transient scripts can optionally be saved in the agent's isolated `brain/scratch/` directory.
3. **Cross-Boundary References**: Customizations inside [skills/](./skills/) or [plugins/](./plugins/) MUST be 100% self-contained. They MUST NOT contain relative links pointing to transient folders like [plans/](./plans/).
4. **Plugin Encapsulation**: Any new MCP server integration MUST be encapsulated inside a named plugin directory within [plugins/](./plugins/) containing a `plugin.json` and `mcp_config.json`.
5. **Concrete Nomenclature**: All contextual configurations MUST use hardcoded, concrete project names and domains. The use of agnostic template variables (like `tupynambalucas.dev`, `Tupynambalucas`) is strictly forbidden outside of internal `knowledge-base` collections.
6. **Environment Variables**: When generating or updating `.env.example` files, agents MUST replace all sensitive values with explicit uppercase placeholders matching the key name (e.g., `API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`). Agents MUST use native shell regex tools (e.g., `sed` or PowerShell `-replace`) to scrub these files and MUST NEVER use inline Node.js scripts parsing multiline strings, as cross-platform line-ending issues cause silent failures and secret leaks.
7. **MCP Fallback Routing**: When the primary `cortex_agentgateway` (provided by the [cortex](./plugins/cortex/) plugin) or its MCP services return connection errors or are offline due to the infrastructure being down, agents MUST automatically fallback to using the local MCP tools provided by the [cortex-fallback](./plugins/cortex-fallback/) plugin.

---

## 3. Required Skill

When creating, updating, or analyzing custom Agent Skills within this bounded context, agents MUST activate the `skill-expert` skill by name before beginning.

---

## 4. Documentation Rules (Diátaxis & AST Variables)

When agents write technical documentation for the monorepo (specifically in the `knowledge-base/` workspace):

1. **Diátaxis Framework**: All documentation MUST be structured into four quadrants (`tutorials`, `guides`, `reference`, `explanation`). The AI must activate the `docusaurus-expert` skill for exact formatting instructions.
2. **AST Project Variables**: Agents MUST use namespace-specific tokens (like `tupynambalucas.dev`) only inside `.mdx`/`.md` files within `knowledge-base/collections/namespaces/*/`. These tokens are dynamically replaced during the build by reading the `*.config.ts` file located at the root of that specific namespace. You MUST NOT use these tokens in global `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or skill files.
